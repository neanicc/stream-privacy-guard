- Eval delta (if any): metric before → after
- Open issues or follow-ups:
```

## 2026-10-12 — Scaffold

- Decision / change: repository created with agent workflows (adapted from the
  Trail/teachAR delivery skills), plan, lanes, eval definitions, human-owned
  thresholds, CI structure (`check` aggregate, protected-path guard, actionlint,
  build/test/eval matrix calling `scripts/ci/run.sh`), Claude staff review on PRs
  and Greptile configuration.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/check_agent_files.py` and actionlint passed on the
  scaffold. No product code exists yet.
- Open issues: plan section 12 open questions; license confirmed at bootstrap.

## 2026-10-12 — SPG-01 Build foundation (#20)

- Decision / change: root CMake project (C++20, CMake 3.25+) with `spg-core`,
  `spg-cli` and tests; Catch2 v3.16.0 via FetchContent pinned by SHA-256;
  `COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR` plus `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow
  -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wold-style-cast` (`/W4 /permissive-` on MSVC)
  on SPG targets only, third-party headers as SYSTEM. `deps/manifest.json` pins
  ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 (official CPU packages; `osx-arm64`, since 1.30 ships no
  universal2), OpenCV 4.9.0 (occ-ai minimal static build, plan question 5
  default) and ccache 4.13.6, each per platform (`linux-x64`, `macos-arm64`,
  `windows-x64`) with SHA-256. `scripts/fetch_deps.py` downloads with curl
  (urllib fallback), verifies the hash, unpacks safely into
  `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/deps/<name>/<version>-<platform>/` and writes a marker that
  CMake checks against the manifest. ccache runs as a compiler launcher for
  Ninja/Makefiles and masquerades as `cl.exe` for Visual Studio (ccache wiki
  method); its cache lives in `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/ccache` so CI restores it.
  macOS deployment target defaults to 14.0 because the ONNX Runtime dylib
  requires it. The `windows-2025` runner now ships Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC
  19.51) and no 2022, so `run.sh build` asks vswhere for the newest Visual Studio
  with C++ tools (`SPG_CMAKE_GENERATOR` overrides); the vc17 OpenCV static libs
  link fine with it. Review follow-up: `fetch_deps.py` holds a per-dependency
  OS file lock (`$SPG_CACHE_DIR/locks/`) from the cache check through the
  marker write, because worktrees share one cache and two concurrent `setup`
  runs could otherwise replace each other's install; the script tests require
  Python 3.12, matching CI and the repository's Python version.
- Evidence (automated, dev Mac, macOS 26.5 arm64, AppleClang 21): every one of
  the 9 pinned archives downloaded and matched its SHA-256
  (`fetch_deps.py --platform all`); `run.sh setup`, `build`, `test` pass with 12
  ctest tests (version, ONNX Runtime version and CPU/CoreML providers, OpenCV
  version and blur, spg-cli exit codes, fetch script hash-mismatch and
  path-traversal refusal); a second build in a fresh directory hit ccache
  112/112; `-DSPG_WITH_DEPS=OFF` builds and passes 10 tests; `run.sh eval`
  still prints `THRESHOLDS: NOT RUN`. CI Check run 38221963583 (head
  `43594ab`) passed on Ubuntu 24.04 (GCC 13.3, Ninja), macOS 15 (AppleClang 17)
  and Windows 2025 (MSVC 19.51, VS 2026), 12/12 tests each; ccache served 112
  of 112 compiles from the restored cache on Ubuntu and handled all 112
  compiles through the `cl.exe` substitution on Windows.
- Eval delta: none (no pipeline yet).
- Open issues or follow-ups: the Windows ONNX Runtime package is CPU-only
  (DirectML/CUDA are separate packages, for SPG-04 to decide); the OpenCV
  prebuilt dates from March 2024, so a refresh or source build may be needed
  later; OBS plugin builds may need the OpenCV libraries checked
  for position-independent code on Linux (SPG-13).

## 2026-10-12 — SPG-04 Model manifest and runtime (#24)

- Decision / change: `models/manifest.json` pins three ONNX models by URL,
  size, SHA-256 and license: YuNet `face_detection_yunet_2023mar` (MIT,
  Hugging Face `opencv/face_detection_yunet` at a commit), and PP-OCR English
  mobile detection `en_PP-OCRv3_det_mobile` and recognition
  `en_PP-OCRv4_rec_mobile` (Apache-2.0, RapidOCR v3.9.2 ONNX conversions on
  ModelScope; the hashes equal RapidOCR's own `default_models.yaml`). This is
  plan question 6's default; SPG-06/07/12 may swap variants (for example
  PP-OCRv5) through the manifest. The recognizer embeds its character
  dictionary in metadata key `character`, so no separate dictionary file is
  pinned. `scripts/fetch_models.py` reuses `fetch_deps.py`'s download, hashing
  and per-item OS lock, verifies size and SHA-256 on a temporary file before
  moving it to `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/models/<name>/<version>/<file>`, deletes a
  cached file that no longer matches, and has `--verify` (no download).
  `run.sh setup` already called it, so CI fetches the models (about 10 MB)
  into the cached `~/.cache/spg`.
- Decision / change: `spg::runtime` (`core/src/runtime/`, target
  `spg-runtime`) wraps ONNX Runtime behind a header with no ORT types.
  `Session::open` tries providers in order (default: CoreML on macOS,
  DirectML then CUDA on Windows, CUDA on Linux), skips ones the loaded build
  lacks, treats a provider as working only after warmup runs succeed, then
  falls back to CPU unless `cpu_fallback` is off. Failures are `RuntimeError`
  with codes (`ModelNotFound`, `ModelLoadFailed`, `ProviderUnavailable`,
  `InvalidInput`, `InferenceFailed`) and messages naming the model path,
  provider attempts, tensor names and shapes, never tensor values. Dynamic
  inputs need explicit warmup shapes (no guessed sizes). `run()` is const and
  safe to call from several threads. CoreML uses MLProgram, compute units ALL
  and `RequireStaticInputShapes=1`: without the last option the
  dynamic-shape PP-OCR models spent 3.4 s (det) and 4.4 s (rec) compiling
  for CoreML, logged an "unbounded dimension" error per layer and ran slower
  than CPU (single runs: det 40.7 ms vs 23.6 ms, rec 22.0 ms vs 6.5 ms).
- Decision / change (Windows GPU): keep the pinned CPU package on Windows in
  this PR. DirectML is the vendor-neutral choice the plan names first, but
  Microsoft's DirectML ONNX Runtime builds stop at 1.24.4 (NuGet
  `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML`), so it would mean a second ORT version
  on Windows or a move to Windows ML execution-provider plugins. ORT 1.30.0
  does ship `win-x64-gpu_cuda12/13` zips, but they need NVIDIA GPUs plus a
  user-installed CUDA and cuDNN. Neither can be validated on GPU-less CI
  runners. The API already names `DirectMl` and `Cuda` (appended through
  ORT's generic `"DML"` registration and `AppendExecutionProvider_CUDA`), so
  packaging is a manifest and CMake change; proposed as a follow-up.
- Evidence (automated, dev Mac: Apple M4, macOS 26.5.2, AppleClang 21):
  `fetch_models.py` downloaded all three models and matched size and SHA-256;
  second run reported all cached; `--verify` passed. `run.sh setup`,
  `build`, `test`: 24/24 ctest tests pass, including 11 `runtime.*` cases
  (tiny Mul models generated at build time by
  `tests/integration/make_runtime_fixtures.py`, no binaries in Git) and
  `scripts.fetch_models` (10 offline tests: hash and size mismatch refused
  and nothing installed, corrupt cache replaced, unsafe names rejected,
  manifest valid). A fresh build against a cache without models reports the
  pinned-model case as Skipped; `-DSPG_WITH_DEPS=OFF` builds and passes
  11 tests. Measurement on the M4 (scratch harness over this wrapper, 50
  runs, constant 0.5 inputs, 3 warmup runs; not a `bench` result):
  YuNet 640x640 CoreML median 2.79 ms (open+warmup 258 ms) vs CPU 4.62 ms;
  det 640x640 CoreML-registered 24.4 ms vs CPU 23.6 ms; rec 48x320 5.5 ms vs
  5.1 ms. With static-shape enforcement CoreML takes no PP-OCR nodes, so
  those two run on CPU either way.
- Review fixes: `warmup()` now checks every warmup shape against the model
  (rank, fixed dimensions, positive dimensions, overflow-safe element count)
  with the same helper as `run()` before allocating any buffer, so a wrong or
  huge shape is `InvalidInput` instead of a multi-GB allocation; opening a
  session with a moved-from `Environment`, or calling any member of a
  moved-from `Session`, is `InvalidInput`, not a null dereference (so the
  `Session` accessors are no longer `noexcept`). The default-provider tests
  now check the recorded attempts
  (earlier providers failed with a reason, the selected one is last) so a
  listed GPU provider that fails on a machine is not a false failure; macOS
  still requires CoreML. Dev Mac: 25/25 ctest tests, 12 `runtime.*` cases.
- Eval delta: none (no pipeline yet; `run.sh eval` still prints
  `THRESHOLDS: NOT RUN`).
- Open issues or follow-ups: package a Windows GPU provider (DirectML via
  1.24.4 or Windows ML, or CUDA) with a Windows GPU test machine; give the
  PP-OCR detector fixed tile shapes (or ORT free-dimension overrides) so
  CoreML can accelerate it (SPG-06/SPG-16); `Session::provider()` names the
  registered provider, and ORT may still place unsupported nodes on CPU;
  `run()` allocates its input values and copies every output per call, so
  SPG-05/06 should measure that in `bench` and decide whether to add a
  caller-owned-output (or `Ort::IoBinding`) overload.

## 2026-10-12 — SPG-13 OBS plugin shell (#26)

- Decision / change: `plugin/` holds `obs-spg`, a C++20 OBS module in the
  obs-plugintemplate layout (`src/`, `data/locale/`, `buildspec.json` at the
  root for name and bundle id, helper scripts in `build-aux/`), built when
  `-DSPG_BUILD_PLUGIN=ON`; `scripts/ci/run.sh` turns it on unless
  `SPG_BUILD_PLUGIN=0`. It registers the video filter `spg_privacy_guard_filter`
  ("Privacy Guard") with a properties stub (status notice, lookahead 500 ms,
  hold 750 ms; saved, not yet used) and links `spg-core` (now built with
  `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`). With no pipeline yet the filter fails
  closed: `video_render` never draws its target and covers the source with an
  opaque fill (the plan's "solid fill" fallback, since the blur effect is
  SPG-14). libobs: OBS 32.1.2 for every OS. Linux links the official
  `OBS-Studio-32.1.2-Ubuntu-24.04-x86_64.deb` release asset (headers, CMake
  package and `libobs.so` only; SIMDe 0.8.2 headers alongside), unpacked by
  `fetch_deps.py`. macOS and Windows follow the template: `build-aux/build_libobs.py`
  builds `libobs` and `obs-frontend-api` from the `OBS-Studio-32.1.2-Sources`
  release against obs-deps 2025-08-23 (the version OBS 32.1.2 pins) and installs
  the Development component into `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/deps/libobs/`, cached by an
  input marker; CMake refuses a cached libobs whose marker differs from the
  current obs-studio, obs-deps (and x86 obs-deps) hashes or builder digest, and
  asks for `setup`. Every archive is in `deps/manifest.json` with SHA-256; OBS's own
  configure-time downloads (obs-deps, Qt, CEF) are disabled by an override
  `buildspec.cmake`, and the 32-bit helper configure OBS always runs on Windows
  gets the pinned x86 obs-deps archive placed in `<source>/.deps`. 32.1.2 rather
  than 32.2.2: 32.2 requires Xcode 26.5 and the `macos-15` runner tops out at
  26.3. OBS 32.1 enables Swift only from a plugin directory, so the macOS build
  injects `enable_language(Swift)` (`CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE`) for libobs-metal.
  `fetch_deps.py` gained `.deb` unpacking, `include` member filters (recorded
  in the unpack marker, so changing the filter unpacks again), explicit
  `{"unused": reason}` platform entries, `"unpack": false` and `--skip-group`.
- Frame-access spike (plan question 1, recommended default kept): readback
  through `gs_texrender` plus `gs_stagesurface`, not an async filter. Display,
  window and game capture are synchronous GPU sources, and OBS documents
  `filter_video` as "only used with asynchronous video filters", so an async
  filter never sees them; a filter on them only gets `video_render`. The
  readback plan for SPG-14: in `video_render`, render the target into a
  downscaled `gs_texrender`, `gs_stage_texture` it into one of two (or three)
  stage surfaces and `gs_stagesurface_map` the surface staged on the previous
  frame, because OBS notes staging stalls unless given a frame to complete;
  the mapped pixels are copied into a bounded queue for the workers and the
  render thread never waits on them. Full-resolution frames for the lookahead
  ring are kept as textures (question 2 default). Audio: a filter cannot delay
  its source's audio, so the default is guidance, not automation: the
  properties will show the Sync Offset (`lookahead_ms`) to set on the audio
  sources tied to the filtered video (Advanced Audio Properties); the plugin
  does not change other sources' offsets itself. Nothing here was measured:
  render-thread cost and stalls need a live OBS run in SPG-14.
- OpenCV PIC check (Linux, SPG-01 note): the occ-ai
  `opencv-linux-v4.9.0-1-Release` static libraries are position-independent.
  `objdump -r` finds no `R_X86_64_32`/`R_X86_64_32S` relocations in
  `libopencv_core.a`, `libopencv_imgproc.a` or `3rdparty/libzlib.a`, and
  `libopencv_core.a` uses `R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX` (1224) and `PLT32`, so they
  can be linked into the plugin module. The shell does not link OpenCV yet.
- Evidence (automated, dev Mac, macOS 26.5 arm64, Xcode 26.6): all five new
  pins downloaded and matched SHA-256 (`fetch_deps.py --platform all
  --no-extract`); the real `.deb` unpacks to 1.8 MB with the include filter;
  `run.sh setup` built libobs 32.1.2 from source with Xcode; `run.sh build`
  and `test` pass 14 tests, including `plugin.exports` (module exports every
  `obs_module_*` entry point) and `plugin.loads` (headless libobs:
  `obs_open_module`/`obs_init_module` succeed, the filter is a registered
  video filter, locale name, defaults and properties as expected);
  `SPG_BUILD_PLUGIN=0` setup/build/test pass 12 tests. CI results are in the PR.
  Not tested: the fail-closed render path (needs a graphics context), loading
  in the OBS app, and `plugin.loads` on Linux (the Ubuntu `libobs.so` needs
  system FFmpeg 6, PulseAudio and Wayland libraries that the pinned inputs do
  not provide, so Linux runs `plugin.exports` only).
- Eval delta: none (no pipeline change; `run.sh eval` still NOT RUN).
- Open issues or follow-ups: live load in OBS on the dev Mac (human);
  packaging the module and its data per OS (SPG-17); readback, ring buffer,
  blur and audio guidance (SPG-14).
