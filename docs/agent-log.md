## YYYY-MM-DD — SPG-xx <title> (#PR)
- Decision / change:
- Evidence: commands run and results (automated / synthetic eval / live / human)
- Eval delta (if any): metric before → after
- Open issues or follow-ups:
```

## 2026-10-12 — Scaffold

- Decision / change: repository created with agent workflows (adapted from the
  Trail/teachAR delivery skills), plan, lanes, eval definitions, human-owned
  thresholds, CI structure (`check` aggregate, protected-path guard, actionlint,
  build/test/eval matrix calling `scripts/ci/run.sh`), Claude staff review on PRs
  and Greptile configuration.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/check_agent_files.py` and actionlint passed on the
  scaffold. No product code exists yet.
- Open issues: plan section 12 open questions; license confirmed at bootstrap.

## 2026-10-12 — SPG-01 Build foundation (#20)

- Decision / change: root CMake project (C++20, CMake 3.25+) with `spg-core`,
  `spg-cli` and tests; Catch2 v3.16.0 via FetchContent pinned by SHA-256;
  `COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR` plus `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow
  -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wold-style-cast` (`/W4 /permissive-` on MSVC)
  on SPG targets only, third-party headers as SYSTEM. `deps/manifest.json` pins
  ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 (official CPU packages; `osx-arm64`, since 1.30 ships no
  universal2), OpenCV 4.9.0 (occ-ai minimal static build, plan question 5
  default) and ccache 4.13.6, each per platform (`linux-x64`, `macos-arm64`,
  `windows-x64`) with SHA-256. `scripts/fetch_deps.py` downloads with curl
  (urllib fallback), verifies the hash, unpacks safely into
  `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/deps/<name>/<version>-<platform>/` and writes a marker that
  CMake checks against the manifest. ccache runs as a compiler launcher for
  Ninja/Makefiles and masquerades as `cl.exe` for Visual Studio (ccache wiki
  method); its cache lives in `$SPG_CACHE_DIR/ccache` so CI restores it.
  macOS deployment target defaults to 14.0 because the ONNX Runtime dylib
  requires it. The `windows-2025` runner now ships Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC
  19.51) and no 2022, so `run.sh build` asks vswhere for the newest Visual Studio
  with C++ tools (`SPG_CMAKE_GENERATOR` overrides); the vc17 OpenCV static libs
  link fine with it. Review follow-up: `fetch_deps.py` holds a per-dependency
  OS file lock (`$SPG_CACHE_DIR/locks/`) from the cache check through the
  marker write, because worktrees share one cache and two concurrent `setup`
  runs could otherwise replace each other's install; the script tests require
  Python 3.12, matching CI and the repository's Python version.
- Evidence (automated, dev Mac, macOS 26.5 arm64, AppleClang 21): every one of
  the 9 pinned archives downloaded and matched its SHA-256
  (`fetch_deps.py --platform all`); `run.sh setup`, `build`, `test` pass with 12
  ctest tests (version, ONNX Runtime version and CPU/CoreML providers, OpenCV
  version and blur, spg-cli exit codes, fetch script hash-mismatch and
  path-traversal refusal); a second build in a fresh directory hit ccache
  112/112; `-DSPG_WITH_DEPS=OFF` builds and passes 10 tests; `run.sh eval`
  still prints `THRESHOLDS: NOT RUN`. CI Check run 38221963583 (head
  `43594ab`) passed on Ubuntu 24.04 (GCC 13.3, Ninja), macOS 15 (AppleClang 17)
  and Windows 2025 (MSVC 19.51, VS 2026), 12/12 tests each; ccache served 112
  of 112 compiles from the restored cache on Ubuntu and handled all 112
  compiles through the `cl.exe` substitution on Windows.
- Eval delta: none (no pipeline yet).
- Open issues or follow-ups: the Windows ONNX Runtime package is CPU-only
  (DirectML/CUDA are separate packages, for SPG-04 to decide); the OpenCV
  prebuilt dates from March 2024, so a refresh or source build may be needed
  later; OBS plugin builds may need the OpenCV libraries checked
  for position-independent code on Linux (SPG-13).

## 2026-10-12 — SPG-02 Core contracts and geometry (#23)

- Decision / change: plan section 5 types as headers in `core/include/spg/`
  (`time`, `frame`, `geometry`, `category`, `detection`, `mask`,
  `policy_config`, `ground_truth`, `secret`, `error`, `json`), documented in
  `docs/contracts.md`. Choices the plan left open: `Timestamp` is int64
  nanoseconds on an arbitrary monotonic epoch with an injected `Clock`
  (`ManualClock` for tests); `FrameView` carries up to three plane pointers and
  strides because NV12 and I420 are planar; one `Category` enum serves enabled
  categories, verdict reason codes (`WATCHLIST`, `PII_CARD`, ...) and
  ground-truth kinds (`watchlist`, `pii:card`, ..., plus `decoy`); `ModelInput`
  is a crop of the readback frame resized by stretch or letterbox (center or
  top-left), so tiles and whole-frame models share one mapping;
  `core/src/frame/geometry.cpp` is the only space converter and computes in
  double; `enclosing_pixels` rounds outward so pixel masks never shrink.
  Watch-list entries and OCR text are a `Secret` type with no stream operator or
  implicit conversion. JSON uses nlohmann/json 3.12.0 (MIT) via FetchContent
  pinned by SHA-256 (`json.tar.xz`, 42f6e95c...), linked privately into
  `spg-core`. Parsing is strict (schema 1, unknown and duplicate fields
  rejected, ranges checked) and errors never forward library text, which can
  quote input. Mask plan JSON is defined now too because the SPG-03 scorer reads
  it. Defaults with no plan value: fuzzy `max_edits` 2, `max_edit_ratio` 0.2,
  `min_partial_chars` 6; margin 4 px + 0.25 x min(w, h); visibility > 0 counts
  as visible. SPG-08/09/03 may tune these with eval evidence.
- Evidence (automated, dev Mac, macOS 26.5 arm64, AppleClang 21):
  `scripts/ci/run.sh setup`, `build`, `test` pass with 36 ctest tests (24 new
  unit tests: round trips between every pair of spaces over 5000 seeded
  mappings, direct vs chained conversion, containment, outward pixel rounding,
  JSON round trips and strictness, fixtures, sentinel test). Mutation check:
  forwarding the JSON library's parse message made the sentinel test fail.
- Eval delta: none; no pipeline stage exists yet (`run.sh eval` still prints
  `THRESHOLDS: NOT RUN`).
- Open issues or follow-ups: SPG-08 owns the normalization and matching that
  interpret `fuzzy`; SPG-09 owns the margin formula; SPG-03 should read the
  committed fixtures in `tests/fixtures/contracts/` to keep the Python side in
  step with the C++ parser.
